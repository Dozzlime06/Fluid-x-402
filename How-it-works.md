# How It Works

1. **Connect Your Wallet**  
Users connect their Base-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the platform. Wallet authentication ensures all activity is on-chain and verifiable.

2. **Explore AI Predictions**  
The platform hosts an AI-powered prediction agent that analyzes events and generates probabilistic forecasts. Users can browse these insights to make informed decisions.

3. **Participate in Prediction Markets**  
Users choose an event to predict outcomes on. Each prediction requires sending USDC through the integrated X402 protocol, ensuring real-time, secure transactions.

4. **Track Market Activity**  
All ongoing predictions, user participation, and event statistics are displayed in a real-time dashboard, showing active markets, AI forecasts, and participation heatmaps.
