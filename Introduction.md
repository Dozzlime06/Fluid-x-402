Introduction

FluidX402 is a web-native prediction platform built on Base (or your chosen chain). It implements the X402 payment protocol, allowing seamless, on-chain stablecoin transactions for event participation.

Users interact with an AI-powered prediction agent, explore real-time market insights, and place predictions on events using USDC. All actions — from market participation to rewards distribution — are fully on-chain and transparent, providing both security and verifiable engagement metrics.

FluidX402 combines token utility and NFT incentives to create a sustainable ecosystem:
	•	Tokens enable platform access, fee discounts, and premium AI insights.
	•	NFTs grant exclusive event participation, reward multipliers, and special bonuses.

The platform’s goal is to foster a dynamic, fair, and transparent prediction market, where all users benefit from engagement, accuracy, and participation.
